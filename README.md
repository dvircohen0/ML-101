This repo contains from scratch implementations of various machine learning algorithms such as:

* Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)
* Decision Tree
* EigenFaces
* Gaussian mixture model (GMM)
* k-means clustering
* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
* t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) 
* k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) 
* Random Forrest
* support-vector machines (SVM)
